## 🍺 About

WailBrew is a modern and intuitive way to manage Homebrew on macOS! It provides a clean graphical interface that makes package management accessible to everyone. From the WailBrew UI, you can:

- View and manage installed formulas and casks
- Search through packages with instant filtering
- Install, uninstall, and upgrade packages
- Check for outdated packages and update them individually or all at once
- View detailed package information including dependencies and conflicts
- Manage Homebrew repositories (tap/untap)

WailBrew was inspired by [Cakebrew](https://www.cakebrew.com/), bringing modern UI design and enhanced functionality to Homebrew package management. Built with [Wails](https://wails.io), Go, and React, it combines native performance with a beautiful, responsive interface.
